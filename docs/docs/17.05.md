## Customization Manager

EBSCO Discovery Service (EDS) is a highly customisable platform that allows subscribers to add on features and functionalities through widgets available on the [EDS Wiki](http://edswiki.ebscohost.com).

The customisation manger (available from version 3.1630+) is a way for the Koha Plugin to implement widgets and customisations. A Koha administrator can implement additional features by going into the Run Tool from the plugins page.
