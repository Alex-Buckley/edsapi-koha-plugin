## Patches

### What are Patches?
Patches are files that are used to replace existing core Koha files to extend the integration of the Koha EDS Plugin. The required feature/functionality cannot be provided through the plugin feature of Koha so core file are updated with additional code.

### Installing a Patch
[All patches are in the patches folder](https://github.com/ebsco/edsapi-koha-plugin/tree/Koha-v3.16.x-to-Koha-v3.22.0x/Patches). Note the directory structure the patch is placed in on GitHub. This replicates the file location from the Koha Core root directory. For example if a file is in the Patches/opac/cgi-bin/opac location in GitHub; the file needs to be placed in <Koha Root>/opac/cgi-bin/opac directory on the server. If the file needs to be replace an existing file; please keep a copy of the original so you can rollback. Some functionalities may require changes to the plugin too.

For example the opac-sendbasket.pl integration required an update in the EDSScript.js file located in the js directory of the plugin. The variable ((patchSendCart)) needs to be set to 1. Refer to the release notes/comments associated with the file as it will contain instructions if any updated need to happen to the plugin.

## Live Update

The Live Update feature in the plugin allows Koha administrators to upgrade and rollback the plugin to available versions. It is recommended that Live Update be run on a test environment first to ensure everything is operational and then run Live Update again on the production/live environment.

To access Live Update go to the plugins page and click on Run tool.

When the button is clicked it informs the administrator that the tool will run an updatability check which tests the permissions on the files.

It does this by running the Live Update Check feature which can be initiated on its own by clicking on the Live Update Check button.

The tool then steps through each file and provides advises if a specified file is updatable or not.

An admin can click on the button to initiate a check again if the updatability check fails.

Once the check passes it initiates the live update process which can take 2 to 3 minutes to execute.

During this time screen the screen is disabled with a loading icon while the plugin fetches the files from rawgit.com for the plugin version specified and updates the existing files on the server.

Please contact your server administrator if you find any issues with the Live Update or the plugin stops working. Functionality can be restored by uploading the plugin from Koha and running chmod 755 on the opac folder of the plugin.

A .htaccess file with the contents “Options +ExecCGI AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl” is created in the opac folder so .pl files are executed.

Also ensure the all files and folders in the EDS plugin folder have a permission setting of 755.
